### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: These issues need actual programming development and should be assigned to users who have a little more experience with open source and the project.
- **qa-needed**: These issues need to be tested for quality assurance (Make sure there are no major issues and that the functionality is normal).
- **documentation-needed**: These are good beginner issues and will also help the user learn the project. These issues mean that a part of the project needs better/further documentation.
- **bug-high-priority**: These are high priority bug issues that should be solved first if possible.
- **bug-low-priority**: These issues; although bugs, are not quite as serious but should still be handled by a person who is familiar with the project.
- **help-wanted**: These issues are good for anyone and just mean help is needed with an issue.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
